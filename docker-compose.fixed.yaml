# Override: run all services with OPTIMIZED=true for before/after comparison.
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.fixed.yaml up -d
#
# This enables optimized code paths in all verticles. Compare flame graphs
# between runs with and without this override to see the performance fixes.
